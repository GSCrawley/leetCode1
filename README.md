# problem #1 : TwoSum Solution
"Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice."

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

# problem #9 : Palindrome Number
"Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward."
